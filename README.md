                                    MY MOTIVATION
My name is David Ubajekwe,im 16 yrs of age i'm a student learning computer science(programming) and these are the things that keep me motivated in my programming journey.
When I started learning computer science fundamentals all that was in my head was just reading of codes that I don’t even know ,I n my head I was like this thing I want to start is going to drain my whole brain capacity. I know it’s going to be hard but I didn’t expect it to be like this.when we started I was so scared that I might not finish well and the lessons I’m not going to learn anything but all things have fallen for my good, all thanks to God .So as things where going well it gave me the confidence to say that I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me, I learnt new things even things I didn’t know existed.It gave me a great sense of achievement. So I continued to explore new things on the internet like before we started I told you that I have a little knowledge about coding using visual studios, I was able to create websites by myself after a while and as we started I remembered that if I put my mind to do something I can do it. 

After all that it gave me the courage to learn more things and research more about programming. Therefore, I would like to learn the relevant theories relatively systematically. And I know that as I start my programming journey I know I will learn new things and succeed I’m my computer science career by the grace of God. And I know having a good teacher like you will even hasten my learning and I myself will also help boost my learning and I know by the end of this lesson I will be able to do anything do able on the computer system.
